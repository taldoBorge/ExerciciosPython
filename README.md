This folder contains my daily exercises and scripts developed while studying Python, focusing on logic, system automation, and security fundamentals.
 Featured Scripts

Here is a breakdown of what I've been working on:

    Security Context: bruteForce.py (logic testing) and Ports.py (port scanning basics).
    System Automation: logOrganizer.py for managing files and tryExcept.py for robust error handling.
    Fundamental Logic: Calculadora.py, Tabuada.py, and other math-based scripts.

 Current Tech Stack & Libraries

I am currently exploring:

    OS & Subprocess: For Linux terminal automation (Arch Linux environment).
    Pandas: For future data and log analysis.
    Time: For script performance and delay management.
